## 📅 High-Fidelity Milestones (April 20Refresh)

### 🤖 Agentic Intelligence (Cortex)
The system has transitioned from a passive data portal to an **Autonomous Agentic Hub**. 
- **Tool-Use Architecture**: Cortex can now autonomously execute database operations (e.g., leave requests, personnel lookups) through natural language.
- **Ecosystem Sync**: Fully integrated with **Google Workspace (Calendar/Drive)** and **Slack**. Cortex can schedule meetings, archive reports, and broadcast live updates to Slack channels without human intervention.
- **Neural Sync UI**: A real-time visual feedback system that shows the AI's "Thinking" and "Acting" states during complex tool-execution loops.

### 💎 "Premium Monolith" Design System
The entire UI has been re-imagined through a high-end, premium lens.
- **Glassmorphism 2.0**: Sophisticated use of backdrop blurs and floating card physics to reduce cognitive load.
- **Dynamic Glow Utilities**: Pulsating borders and radial background glows that denote system intelligence and live data streams.
- **Fluid Executive Dashboards**: Redesigned **Director** and **Manager** views with high-density metrics and interactive "Meritocracy Audits."

### 🛡️ Enterprise Hardening (Fortress)
- **100% Type Safety**: Complete refactor of core utility services (PDF, Storage, Insights) to eliminate `any` types and enforce strict DTO contracts.
- **Reliability Layer**: Root-level `PageErrorBoundary` and centralized session hardening to prevent white-screen crashes and session leaks.
- **Institutional Testing**: 45+ logical test passes across the most fragile modules (Payroll, Targets, Appraisals).
